												<p style="margin-top:35px;">Craig Derington has been developing web applications for more than 20 years. Craig got started in computers and networking as a Sergeant in the United States Army in 1994. Craig was assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 3rd ID Tactical Operations Center and was responsible for all Brigade command and subordinate units status reporting. The Army was utilizing a new real-time, web-based battlefield personnel and minefield tracking tool, SAPERNET, a program in which Craig was a junior developer. It was quite revolutionary in its time. A US Army program that allowed Commanders to get immediate battlefield data via a web browser in the Command vehicles, talking to web servers located in the Division Main Rear position, all via Mobile Subscriber Equipment.  MSE later became the foundation for  packet data switching over cell phone towers &amp; networks.  This lead to Craig's interest in Electrical Engineering and Motorola's iDEN technology.</p>

					<p>Craig continued his <i>on-the-job-education</i> and excelled in the Army, both personally and professionally.  Craig successfully implemented dozens of computerized supply channel and document register improvements within the Engineer Brigade increasing unit operating efficiency. Craig was subsequently awarded the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Achievement Medal with 3 clovers; as well as many other unit citations and individual achievements.</p>

					<p>Craig was honorably discharged from the Army in 1999 as a Microsoft Certified Professional and began a successful career at DirectWireless.  In 1999, DirectWireless was a small private NEXTEL Authorized Service Center in Maitland, FL.  Craig, along with the two principals, turned the operation into 30 stores in the Southeastern US in less than 5 years.  All internal and remote systems communicating over Virtual Private Networks utilizing ERP type applications.  Craig traveled to every location, opened every store and trained and managed staff as well as all computer and network operations.  Craig built and ran the company's online cellular accessories business and affiliate marketing programs. The company vaulted from less than $1 million in annual sales to more than $10 million/year in only the 3rd year of operation.</p>

					<p>Craig's diverse skill set, along with his passionate drive for excellence, US Army Leadership Development Training, continuous professional development, and his dynamic personality; created a situation in which his limited time was in high demand.  Craig split his time between managing 30 retail stores, 6 District Managers and hundreds of employees, while also working as the sole developer of the first ever Repair Depot web application. The application Craig developed became the launch pad for the creation of a new company and Craig became a founding member of Repair Resource in Sanford, FL. This new enterprise application scaled to thousands of users across the country within weeks of the rollout. Nextel Authorized Service Centers began submitting their units online and shipping them to the Repair Depot in 2003.  Six months later, the new business and software application was generating in excess of $400,000 dollars per month in revenue, employing 85 people and was responsible for tracking more than 80,000 individual phones and accessories each month. Millions of dollars of phones and repair parts inventory, all tracked in real time and accessible to the repair centers around the country any time of day. This was Craig's first foray into developing web applications in the Enterprise. After 7 years of grueling retail management and 90 hour work weeks, Craig wanted to focus his life's work on creating world class high availability, high performance web applications.</p>

					<p>Nextel and Sprint merged in late 2005, so Craig left corporate America for the small business sector and founded his first company, Intranet Systems Solutions in 2006. Now working independently, Craig quickly evolved his skills and refined the User Interface and User Experience with elegant Bootstrapping, Javascript frameworks, and design wire framing with a code-first, code-fast methodology for rapid application development. Craig focused on building simple, yet expertly designed, thoroughly-obsessive web applications. Craig learned complex systems and database architecture and began developing business applications with ColdFusion and SQL Server in 2007.</p>

					<p>Intranet System Solutions dissolved for personal reasons in early 2007.  Craig self incorporated in the late fall of 2007.</p>

					<p>Student Loan Repayment.us is the culmination of 25 years of passionately driven web application design and life experience.</p>
